# Gestures 
- a working attempt (albeit an unorganized attempt) to implement global gestures for windows 11 via winforms.
- For my use its handy to Copy text to the clipborad, but i think that there are other applications for a globaL hotkey that runs some code.  for example: running some batch script, running an application, performing updates to files. etc
