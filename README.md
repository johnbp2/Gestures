# Gestures 
- a working attempt (albeit an unorganized attempt) to implement global gestures for windows 11 via winforms.
- I wanted to manipulate thr clipborad, but you can do whatever with the delegate linkeds to the gesture
- This is a work in progress more to come (like a design, roadmap, and modernizations in the code.
